react-markdown is a markdown component for React.

üëâ Changes are re-rendered as you type.

üëà Try writing some markdown on the left.

## Overview

* Follows [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)
* Optionally follows [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
// * Renders actual React elements instead of using dangerouslySetInnerHTML
// * Lets you define your own components (to render MyHeading instead of h1)
* Has a lot of plugins

## Table of contents

## Syntax highlighting

Pretty neat, eh?

## GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)

For GFM, you can *also* use a plugin:
["remark-gfm"](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use).
It adds support for GitHub-specific extensions to the language:
tables, strikethrough, tasklists, and literal URLs.

These features **do not work by default**.
üëÜ Use the toggle above to add the plugin.

| Feature    | Support  |
| ---------: | :------------------- |
| CommonMark | 100%     |
| GFM        | 100% w/ "remark-gfm" |

~~strikethrough~~

* [ ] task list
* [x] checked item

## HTML in markdown

‚ö†Ô∏è HTML in markdown is quite unsafe, but if you want to support it, you can
use ["rehype-raw"](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw).
You should probably combine it with
["rehype-sanitize"](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize).
